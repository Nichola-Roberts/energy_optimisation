# Human Behaviour Explained by Energy Optimization

__Nichola Roberts__


# Abstract

This paper presents a framework to explain the why behind human decision making. Highlighting that at the core we are just animals trying to minimise energy consumption. My framework shows that once you assume humans are a social species with a symbiotic relationship between the individual and the community, many previously counterintuitive behaviours have clear mechanisms. 

This paper aims to start from some core first principles and hopes to build towards a cohesive model of human behaviour.


# Instantaneous Energy Budget

__Principle 1: Energy Budget is Instantaneous__

Energy available to humans has an instantaneous cap. The brain decides how to spend this energy through a combination of conscious and unconscious processes. Some of these processes are:



1. Background Unconscious Processes - The process we need to keep ticking over i.e. pumping blood around the body, breathing, physical body changes like growth. 
2. The Brain - Cognitive processes carried out by the brain
3. Physical Movement - Moving around the physical world, going for a jog, walking to the bus stop ect.
4. Bodily Responses to Stimuli - These are our responses to the external world, things like faster heartbeat, tensed muscles. This can be current stimuli or thinking about future scenarios and imagining them play out.
5. Neurochemical and Neurotransmitter creation 


# Projected Energy Expenditure

__Principle 2: Brain Predicts Energy Expenditure for Future Decisions __

The brain looks at potential actions and predicts how these will play out. Mapping out different action paths and the energy required for each of these action paths. 

For instance, waking up in the morning. Feeling a want for a coffee. The brain thinks I could go downstairs and put the kettle on, that feels easy. I could walk to a coffee shop, that doesn’t seem worth the energy this morning. Or taking this a stage further, I could go to the coffee shop. But that would mean I’m late for work, and I’m already on my final warning, I would probably get sacked. Then I would have a huge amount of stress, taking up a lot of energy. I might not have enough money, and then just paying for food would become a stressor. It’s probably best just to put the kettle on. 


# Energy Landscape Metaphor

To try to visualise this more clearly, we can imagine a landscape of mountains and valleys. Mountains represent the action paths that feel hard, and will take a significant amount of energy expenditure. Not just for the physical actions, but the emotional consequences. For instance, telling your partner you cheated, saying the words is easy, but even just imaging the consequences leads to an immediate stress and anxiety response. They will get angry, probably break up with me, where will I live. The action of saying “I cheated” now feels impossible once the full action path is considered. 

Conversely, the valleys represent happier times. Like falling in love. Imagine you are a ball rolling around this landscape. You meet someone new, you feel a pull towards them, an inevitability, like a ball rolling down into a valley under gravity. A feeling that it’s just meant to be. The stress of your micromanaging boss just fades away, it’s no longer important. You feel happy. 

The position of your ball represents the current energy state. So imagine you were born wealthy, had a happy life and are currently happily married. You are very low in this energy landscape, you require very little energy to maintain this position. You have a lot of “free energy” to play with, this might even feel like boredom. We will come to how this energy might be spent later. 


# Social Influences

Other people affect our landscapes, it’s in a state of constant flux. Your car breaks down, a stress response, a hill appears underneath your feet. Your partner smiles at you, you feel happier, reducing your annoyance that they didn’t empty the dishwasher, and therefore your stress level.

Another example, you are a teenager excited and about to go out to play football with your friends. Your mum shouts at you, she thinks you wound up your brother on purpose. You suddenly feel stressed, and your body reacts with a stress response, taking up some of your “free energy”. Suddenly you can’t go out and play football, you can’t muster up the energy, you just want to go lie in bed. A mountain has suddenly formed. Maybe you could try to flatten this mountain, maybe defend yourself to your mum, she might be reasonable and your stress responses might calm down. Instead arguing back might just trigger her responses causing a mountain in her own landscape. An escalation of the situation, even more stress and potential consequences from your mum. 

Interactions also  have the power to reduce your energy expenditure. For instance, discussing work problems with a friend, getting it out of your system, and calming your stress responses. Some things feel instantly calming, like a hug from your partner. Sometimes action paths that felt impossible suddenly seem possible when you have someone who cares by your side. 

This is also true on a societal level. As humans we have created a world that on many fronts reduces the energy expenditure to achieve basic functions. We can go to the shop to buy food in a car, instead of running after and hunting a rabbit for lunch. We have houses, we have TV to help forget about our lives worries. Passing of knowledge and culture can also help reduce energy expenditure. For instance, the knowledge that meditation is calming and helpful. 


# Relationship Examples

(need to rewrite)


## New Relationship 

When you first fall in love with someone it’s like a rush of energy (co regulation, happiness, relaxation, lowered stress, feelings of safety). This is like your balling rolling down the hill discovering a whole new landscape. You have so much more energy to spend, and everything looks different, because it is, it feels exciting to explore it. 

Daily hills that you used to dread are barely visible, everything feels more possible. Over time this new background energy level becomes the new normal. You lose the initial rush, but you keep the majority of the lowered energy state as long as the relationship keeps the connection and the coregulation. 


## Controlling Relationships

As we said before people can affect your landscape, when someone shouts they can create a mountain in your landscape. Imagine someone creating mountain ranges when you behave in ways they don’t approve. Suddenly you're trapped in their predetermined valleys, probably in addition and praise for being there too. And in their landscape, you are so well trained you don’t give them any hills. Escape routes are blocked by the mountains, you have high stress just wanting to visit your friend, while they are feeling carefree and able to do what they like. 

Imagine the energy it takes to leave, the anxiety in the body, then when you get the courage you have no where to live, even more mountains. No wonder sometimes where you just take the easy option of rolling back down, the rush of falling in love under gravity again. 


## One Off Relationships

Two people meet and fall in love. Everything is going perfect, until a relatively innocent comment by one triggers the other (could be patterns from childhood), they feel a surge of anxiety creates a mountain in their landscape, the feeling is overwhelming they need to get down. They try to calmly ask their what they meant. The avoidant can sense trouble brewing, their own mountain forms, causing them to react. Before long there are constantly shift mountains all over their landscapes. It becomes too much to bare. They separate. Over time they come to miss each other and a pathway back together. They roll down the mountains over again, the feeling of falling in love again, the feeling of inevitably, a meant to be, a ball rolling under gravity. The cycle repeats. They may be “in love” but the feeling is an addition to the repeated rush down the mountains, not the calm of a safe stable relationship. 


# Prediction 

__Principle 3: The Brain can Hold and Handle the Uncertainty__

Human behaviour by its nature is unpredictable. Other people's behaviour for instance is not predictable. Yesterday your boss loved your proposal, today he’s in a bad mood because his new born baby kept him awake all night. He now thinks everything you do is wrong, you decide it’s best to just stay out of his way. Today has not played out how you expected it to. 

When mapping out action paths the brain takes this into account. For instance buying your mother in law a christmas present. You think she might love a necklace you saw in a shop, you're 90% sure she will love it, but there is 10% doubt she might hate it. But then she loves wine, you could just get her favourite wine. It’s a safer bet, but she is not going to love it in the same way.

# Path Selection Examples

__Principle 4: Only Action Paths within the Energy Budget are Viewable__

While the brain might predict over all known action paths, only the actions paths within the energy budget constraints are viewable by the conscious. This is the forward predicted consequences too, if one point of the path exceeds the energy budget the path is not deemed feasible. 

Some “paths” are pure fantasy, winning the lottery and living in a mansion. This is obviously a fantasy and not an action path. It’s typically clear what is real and what is wishful thinking.

Some paths look very steep, for instance cleaning the house after you’ve had a secret party while your parents are away. Your energy is low, but it’s still achievable, especially when balanced against the stress of them coming home to the messy house. 

The motivation for which path to take can have a significant impact on which path is chosen. For instance, your friend has just had an argument with her new boyfriend. You are worried about her and rush round to make sure she is ok. You also feel good, that you’ve helped her feel better. However, fast forward two years, she’s just broken up with him again for the 60th time. You do still care, but you have your own stuff going on. It’s not that you are incapable of going, but the hill has significantly grown. And you know even if you go this time, this will add to the resentment and the hill will be bigger next time. Best to just get in the bath and relax and worry about your own life instead. 

Another demonstration of the invisible action paths. Imagine you have an anxious avoidant attachment system. You’ve recently started seeing someone, you have a funny feeling inside, it feels a bit like love. Instead of feeling happy, you get a sudden wave of anxiety, it feels more than you can bear. Your partner looks at you questioningly, you just want to run. Saying anything nice feels impossible, you still just want to run. There are no action paths of kindness. You are completely stressed out from the anxiety, from the current moment and the future predictions and expectations they will have of you.

It’s not that the other paths are physically impossible, you just don’t have the energy budget for them and the interactions that will follow. Some future consequences would exceed your maximum energy budget. Your consciousness can’t see the paths you don’t have the energy to take. 

This also explains the feeling of depression, stuck in a rut. You are in a little valley but this one is high up on the energy landscape. Everywhere you look there are hills of anxiety. Applying for a job, that’s hard, that makes me anxious, paying my rent, that’s hard, leaving the house that’s hard, gives me anxiety, getting out of bed, that’s anxiety. No paths seem possible, you just don’t have the energy. Maybe if your friend comes, you can get some co regulation and leave the house together. Maybe if your mum comes round and shouts at you, staying in bed suddenly becomes the biggest hill. 

Someone who is depressed, with high background stress and anxiety cannot “see” their paths out, even if others point them out. The paths described by others stay purely theoretical. This can be mitigated by offering to break it into smaller steps and having someone care about them willing to take the journey with them.

Our minds are not just looking for the optimal path in sight, and to stay there. They are built to keep looking for that long term sustainable lower energy state. Action paths could map out seconds, minutes, years depending on the scenario. 


# Feedback Mechanism

__Principle 5: Emotions are the Bodies Feedback Mechanism__

Bodily responses are our feedback mechanism. We can literally feel the slope of the ground below us. We forgot our partner’s birthday, we can feel the stress rising in our body. We know the path we took has led to a bad outcome. This helps motivate us to go out get some flowers, trying to flatten the hill we are anticipating. It also helps us to see we should have made slightly better decisions leading up to this moment, and maybe we will learn from this for next year. 

We can also sense when the landscape suddenly changes. We go into a shop to buy a sandwich, but we realise we have no money. To get the sandwich we now get creative, we have to steal, maybe in secret, maybe at gunpoint. Both of these could have quite severe consequences, we start feeling stressed at the predictions, and decide we just don’t have enough energy to handle these consequences and it might be better just to walk home hungry. 

That is how we directly feel the steepness of the slope below us. The gradient. The ball instantly knows it’s starting up a big hill or rolling down. Our emotions map the bodily reactions, and feed this information to the brain. We have different bodily reactions to stimuli, and this causes different chemicals to be released. These emotions are our signal to identify the state of the current moment, but also act as feedback to train the brain to make better predictions and decisions next time we experience something similar. 


# Learning / Sampling Mechanism 

__Principle 6: The Brain Learns from Emotional Feedback__

The emotional feedback rewards the brain and the actions taken with it creates positive results, encouraging this behaviour. Powerful emotions lead to strong powerful updates. For instance, being around this person makes me very happy, I should be around them as much as possible. 

We all know the feeling of falling in love, our brain preoccupied with learning all about our new partner, new experiences, building new pathways, you just can’t get them off your mind. Our body is filled with the chemicals associated with happy emotions.

The same is true in converse. Love and relationships never work out and I always get hurt when I fall in love, I should avoid falling in love. 


# Societal Influence on Motivation and Learning

__Principle 7: Humans also Optimise for Socitial Energy Minimisation __

We are a social species and there are significant benefits to an individual energy minimisation when living in a society. This evolutionary advantage has led to an optimisation of societal structures baked into our feedback mechanism for motivation and learning. Different personalities have different optimisation strategies, this creates a balanced society. Which leads to lower individual energy expenditure. 

Personality can vary significantly. Some people prioritise stability, some prioritise taking immediate action, some careful planning. Some prioritise social relationship bulding and co regulation, some people prioritise creating process and structures. Some people prioritise exploration and discovery. Some prioritise co regulation through art, and this art also helps co regulate others. 

Personality motivated by meaning, values, identity, and purpose can drive people to deliberately choose high-energy paths as this benefits society overall. 


# Consciousness

__Principle 8: Consciousness Follows from our Need to Make Better Predictions __

The brain models various parts of our physical world and our place in it. I postulate that consciousness has arisen to fulfil the need to predict our own brain patterns. Predicting and simulating our future actions and future responses.

Also given that we are social species. It makes sense that our brains would evolve to also predict the actions of others. A conscious layer creating simplified narratives of neural pathways has significant benefits. As we watch our own brains we also gain more understanding of others. 

Conscious thoughts seem to be a simplified explanation for the more detailed and intensive brain processes of the unconscious brain. For instance “This food takes nice” instead of the 10,000 neurons firing up to determine this viewpoint. Or “This group of people feels safe” rather than the neurons monitoring the microexpressions on each person’s face. 


# Core beliefs

__Principle 9: Core Beliefs are Simplified Narratives made by the Conscious__

Sometimes consequences are so severe and so threatening that we want to make sure we don’t explore that area of the map again. This is especially true in childhood, when I child might have the understanding to make more nuanced interpretations. The consciousness learns broad statements like “I am bad”, “I am unlovable”. This effectively blocks off whole areas of the landscape that feel impossible to even look at without an overwhelming feeling of stress. You can carry these into adulthood, narrowing your field of view and possible actions to take, and probably giving you background anxiety when you even touch upon something nearby 

This background stress and blocked off paths can severely limit your options. You have lower free energy budget to spend, and less paths to choose from. You might be forced down a “least bad” path, that actually blows up in your face further. Creating an anxiety spiral. For instance, you don’t have a job, you’re short of money. You want to apply for jobs but the background anxiety is high, you feel unworthy of a job, and like you would probably be inadequate if you to one. Looking through jobs you manage to push through the anxiety and apply for one. The day of the interview comes along and you are stressed out of your mind. You are convinced they will see straight through you. They ask you a hard question, but one you could answer if you were relaxed, you can’t think, you fail to answer. You don’t get the job. It added weight to your core belief that you are just not as good as others and don’t deserve a job, making it even more stressful to go through this process again. 

Compare this to someone who is confident in their abilities, they don’t have the harmful core belief. They apply for 10 jobs in one day, feel relaxed at every interview because they know another one will turn up if this isn't right. Even if they get turned down, they can see it as just one of those things. They quickly get a job.


# Cognitive Dissonance

__Principle 10: Cognitive Dissonance Shifts Based on Free Energy Budgets __

Cognitive dissonance is when your consciousness believes something, but signals in your brain might be telling you it’s not the full story. You might have experienced contradictory experiences, but the meaning the consciousness has given is keeping you safe for now. 

This can also be affected by available energy budget. When you are stressed you can only see the core belief. When you are more relaxed you are able to take risks and paths, that help test and refine this area of the landscape, over time removing the broad core belief. 


# Alcohol and Addiction

Alcohol is a depressant, and therefore can minimise stress responses. When someone’s background stress leaves them with a lack of energy to make the changes needed in life alcohol and substances become the only option. Dampening stress responses, and the predicted stress responses for consequences when drinking. This shows why stimulators giving positive emotional responses are even more addictive, they are creating pathways rewarding this behaviour. 

This shows why recovering programs fail. Creating a false environment where background stress is removed, giving them the ability to temporarily stop drinking. Then after a period putting them right back in the environment with high background stress. Setting them up for failure, while also reinforcing core beliefs about inadequacy and shame. 


# Mathematical / Scientific Framing

__Principle 11: Human Behaviour is Chaotic and Unpredictable__

Behind this theory is optimisation theory, concepts like gradient descent. It does not aim to suggest that human behavior is predictable. Just that it is understandable. Human behavior is a chaotic system like the weather. Like the butterfly effect. It is not possible to accurately predict long term human behavior.
