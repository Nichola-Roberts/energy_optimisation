### Core Discovery #1: The DMN/TPN Architecture

**Default Mode Network (Introverted Functions):**
- Ni → Precuneus (consciousness, pattern synthesis)
- Si → Parahippocampal Cortex (experiential memory, context)
- Ti → Angular Gyrus (logical frameworks) 
- Fi → vmPFC (personal values, meaning)

**Task-Positive Network (Extraverted Functions):**
- Ne → Frontopolar Cortex (possibility exploration)
- Se → Superior Parietal Lobule (sensorimotor integration)
- Te → Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (executive planning)
- Fe → Temporal-Parietal Junction (social cognition)

**The Critical Anti-correlation:** DMN and TPN cannot be fully active simultaneously - they operate like a seesaw.

### Core Discovery #2: Consciousness and the Two Selves

**Consciousness likely resides in the DMN** - the "default" state when tasks are stripped away. This means:
- Introverts live in consciousness and visit the external world
- Extroverts live in the external world and visit consciousness

**Two Self-Systems:**
- Internal Self (DMN): Ti and Fi - your logical framework AND values are both "you"
- Relational Self (TPN): How you exist in relation to others

Cultural bias toward Fi ("feelings = true self") has obscured that Ti (personal logic) is equally the internal self.

### Core Discovery #4: The Neuroscience Bias

**Modern neuroscience has accidentally been studying primarily xNTJ brains!**

Evidence:
- Most clearly mapped regions are Te (lateral PFC), Fi (vmPFC), and Ni (precuneus)
- The "volunteers for brain studies" personality type
- Math/logic placed in Te regions (where xNTJs process it)

This creates two problems:
1. **Sampling bias**: Studying one type and universalizing
2. **Averaging catastrophe**: Mixing incompatible types creates noise, not signal

### Core Discovery #5: Connection Patterns, Not Regions

**Same function = same brain region for everyone**
BUT
**Different connection patterns create different experiences**

Example:
- Angular Gyrus = Ti for everyone
- INTP: Connects broadly for theoretical integration
- INFJ: Connects to Fe/Ni regions for human understanding
- The region is the same, the network is different

### Implications:

1. **Personality types reveal brain function better than brain scans** - they show the subjective experience and purpose, not just activation

2. **There may be no "general human brain"** - only 16 different optimization patterns using the same hardware

3. **Neuroscience findings need reinterpretation** - they've been studying xNTJ connectivity and calling it human nature

4. **Development is about rewiring connections** - not accessing new regions but creating new pathways
