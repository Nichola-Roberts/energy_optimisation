Cognitive Functions to Brain Regions Mapping
Core Framework
DMN (Default Mode Network) - Introverted Functions
Active during rest, internal focus, and self-referential processing. Anti-correlated with TPN.
Function Mappings

Ni → Precuneus

Mental simulation, consciousness, future visualization
Accuracy: 9/10


Si → Parahippocampal Cortex

Familiarity detection, context recognition
Accuracy: 9/10


Ti → Angular Gyrus

Logical relationships, mathematical reasoning, abstract analysis
Accuracy: 8/10


Fi → vmPFC (Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex)

Personal values, self-referential meaning
Accuracy: 10/10



TPN (Task-Positive Network) - Extraverted Functions
Active during external tasks and environmental engagement. Anti-correlated with DMN.
Function Mappings

Ne → Frontopolar Cortex (BA10)

Possibility exploration, "what if" processing
Accuracy: 9/10


Se → Superior Parietal Lobule (SPL)

Real-time sensorimotor integration, spatial awareness
Accuracy: 8/10


Te → Lateral Prefrontal Cortex

Executive planning, external organization
Accuracy: 8/10


Fe → Temporal-Parietal Junction (TPJ)

Social cognition, reading others' mental states
Accuracy: 9/10



Variable/Shared Regions
Context-Dependent Assignment

PCC (Posterior Cingulate Cortex) → Sense of self

Links to Ti OR Fi depending on person
Creates identity from introverted judging function


Retrosplenial Cortex → Pattern recognition

Links to Si OR Ni depending on usage
Backward-looking (Si) vs forward-looking (Ni) patterns



Universal Infrastructure

Hippocampus → Episodic memory formation (all types use)
ACC/Anterior Insula → Domain monitoring (2nd function)

Monitors progress toward type's "life mission"
Bridges DMN and TPN



Unmapped Regions
DMN Regions

dmPFC (dorsomedial PFC) - social cognition
Middle Temporal Gyrus - semantic concepts
Temporal Poles - social/emotional concepts
Inferior Parietal Lobule (parts) - integration

TPN Regions

dACC - conflict monitoring
Anterior Insula - salience/switching (possibly linked to 2nd function)
Supplementary Motor Area - movement planning
Premotor Cortex - motor preparation
Intraparietal Sulcus - attention/math (Ti placement controversial)
Frontal Eye Fields - visual attention
